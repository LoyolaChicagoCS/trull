<em>Trull (TRiveni ULtra Light)</em>
is a framework for concurrent programming with objects, events, and threads.  
</p>
<p>
Trull supports the modular design of event-driven systems from
building blocks, including basic abstract behaviors and
combinators that operate on abstract behaviors.  
Trull supports the sequential, non-overlapping processing of events
by a single thread.  Therefore, explicit multithreading or concurrency
control is unnecessary in most cases.  
Moreover, the Trull Task framework provides support
for components that require autonomous behavior.  
Trull components are compliant with the JavaBeans
specification and integrate seamlessly with Swing and other suitable JavaBeans.
Trull also includes an XML-based front end.
