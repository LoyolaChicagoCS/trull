Contains all the classes for building systems in Trull,
a framework for concurrent programming with objects, threads, and
events in Java.  Trull supports the modular design of event-driven
systems through combinators that operate on abstract behaviors.
</p>
<p>An Trull software component combines three aspects of behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>object-oriented behavior based on methods and instance variables;</li>
<li>event-driven (reactive) behavior based on responses to events received
from the environment;</li>
<li>autonomous behavior based on threads that evolve independently.</li>
</ul>
<p>
All three aspects of behavior may result in the emission of events to the
surrounding system (the component's environment).
</p>
<p>A class for a custom Trull component is usually declared
by extending one of the classes that implement the interface <code>Component</code> 
and providing any necessary
instance variables for the object-oriented aspects of the component. The
event-driven aspects of the expression are usually provided in the
constructor. The thread-based aspects are usually provided by implementing
the lifecycle methods; specific support for such components is provided by the 
Trull Task framework.
</p>
<p>
Code that interacts with the object-oriented aspects of a
Trull component may be embedded in the event-driven behavior in the
form of embedded listeners, event functions, 
predicates, and valuators. Using combinators,
complex components may be built hierarchically from 
existing components.
